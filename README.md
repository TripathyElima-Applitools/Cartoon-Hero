# Cartoon Hero Website - Tom & Jerry

## Description

This website is a fun tribute to my 4-year-old son's favorite cartoon, **Tom & Jerry**. I created this site to showcase the playful and humorous nature of the show through fun design and interactive elements. The project was an excellent opportunity for me to learn the basics of web development using **HTML** and **CSS** from a Skillshare class, and I aimed to combine my son's love for Tom & Jerry with my newfound coding skills.

The website includes:
- **Header images** featuring Tom and Jerry.
- A **funny description** written from my son’s perspective about Tom and Jerry.
- A **short Tom & Jerry video** to relax and make your day more enjoyable.
- **Clickable icons** that redirect users to pages where they can buy Tom & Jerry-themed merchandise (e.g., T-shirts, stickers) on Amazon or learn more about the show on Wikipedia.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for the basic structure and content of the website.
- **CSS** for styling and layout of the webpage.

## Design Process

### Color Scheme and Layout Choices
- **Color Scheme**: I chose a playful and bright color palette inspired by the classic cartoon's primary colors—bold reds, yellows, and blues to create an inviting, fun vibe.
- **Layout**: The layout is simple and user-friendly, with a large header image of Tom and Jerry at the top. Below that, a short description adds a personal touch, followed by a small embedded video. The icons for external links (Amazon and Wikipedia) are placed for easy access in the footer. 

I wanted to keep it clean and simple to make sure my son’s 4-year-old friends (and other users) could easily navigate.

### Wireframes
- **Desktop View**: The desktop version has a full-width header image, followed by a section for the description, video, and clickable links/icons placed in a grid layout.
- **Mobile View**: Needs to be implemented 

## Current Features

- **Header Images**: Displays images of Tom and Jerry to immediately engage the user.
- **Funny Description**: A short description written from my son's perspective about the show, bringing a personal touch to the website.
- **Tom & Jerry Video**: Embedded a short video clip of Tom and Jerry for a relaxed viewing experience.
- **Clickable Icons**: Redirects to Amazon for Tom & Jerry merchandise (T-shirts, stickers) and Wikipedia for more information on the show.

## Bugs Encountered and Fixed

While building the site, I faced several challenges, especially with **styling and CSS**. Some bugs I encountered include:
- **Image alignment issues**: Took a while to get the images aligned properly in both desktop and mobile views.
- **Text overflow**: The text would overflow out of containers on smaller screens, which I fixed using media queries.
- **Unresponsive design**: Initially, the design wasn’t fully responsive, but I was able to fix this by using flexible containers and proper CSS grid layouts.

I was able to troubleshoot and resolve these issues with a combination of learning resources and hands-on testing. Reviewing the code with **Onoyonika** also gave me some great suggestions that I plan to implement in the future.

## Features to be Implemented in Future Releases

- **Additional Interactive Features**: Add more interactive features such as mini-games or quizzes about Tom and Jerry.
- **Responsive Improvements**: Fine-tune the responsiveness of the site for all device sizes.
- **User Comments Section**: Implement a section where visitors can leave comments or share their favorite Tom & Jerry moments.

## Deployment Steps

To deploy the website:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the folder in your preferred code editor.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the website locally.
4. If you want to host the website online, you can deploy it using services like **GitHub Pages** or **Netlify**. For GitHub Pages:
   - Push the repository to your GitHub account.
   - Go to your repository's settings, find the **GitHub Pages** section, and select the branch you want to deploy (typically `main` or `master`).
   - Your site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>`.

## Testing Attempts

### Manual Testing:
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Checked the site on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari to ensure it looks good and functions properly across major browsers.
- **Responsiveness Testing**: Used browser developer tools to test the site on different screen sizes, ensuring it works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Automated Testing:
- Although I didn't set up automated tests for this project (as it is simple HTML/CSS), I plan to incorporate them into future releases.
